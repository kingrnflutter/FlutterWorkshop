    "animal": "African Penguin",
    "description":"The African Penguin is a small to medium sized Penguin species that is found along the coast of South Africa and on a number of its surrounding islands. The African Penguin is thought to be most closely related to the Humboldt and Magellanic Penguins found in southern South America, and the Galapagos Penguin found in the Pacific Ocean near the Equator. The African Penguin was named for the fact that it is the only species of Penguin that is found breeding on the African Coast, and it is believed to be one of the first Penguin species to be discovered by humans.",

    "animal": "Burrowing Owl",
"description": "The burrowing owl is a slender, long-legged bird found across the Americas.

This owl plays an important ecological role by regulating the number of prey in their natural habitats."

    "animal": "Cheetah",
"description":"The Cheetah is a large and powerful feline that was once found throughout Africa and Asia and even in parts of Europe. Today however, it is found in only a few remote regions of its once vast natural range, primarily due to growing Human settlements and the hunting of them for their fur. There are widely considered to be five different subspecies of Cheetah that vary only very slightly in colouration and are most easily distinguished by their geographic location."

    "animal": "Electric Eels",
"description":"Known as the “numb fish” in some parts of the world, the electric eel isn’t a true eel. This freshwater fish resides predominantly in the Amazon, even though the larvae float to New Zealand as they hatch. The bony body of the fish keeps it from offering much meat in eclectic dishes, but their exclusivity creates high demand.",

    "animal": "Impala",
    "description":
"Impala are animals that live in the light woodlands and savanna of southern and eastern Africa. These medium-sized antelopes travel and gather in herds of hundreds during the rainy season. The rains bring a bounty of grasses, shoots, herbs, bushes and shrubs for their grazing. In the dry season, these herds work together to find food in a process called “browsing,” as part of which they eat leaves, twigs and higher-growing vegetation.",

    "description":
"The Jaguar is the largest feline on the American continent, and is the only one of the world’s ‘big’ cats to be found in the New World. Jaguars are animals that are closely related to Leopards and have a number of similar characteristics including the distinctive spotted pattern on their fur. The Jaguar is the third biggest Cat in the world behind the Tiger and the Lion and is well known for its immense power and agility. In fact, the name Jaguar is said to come from the Native American word yaguar which means “he who kills with one leap”. Despite their incredible power however, Jaguars have been hunted through the ages mainly for their staggeringly beautiful fur. Although hunting for Jaguar fur is now prohibited, population numbers have declined throughout much of their natural range, with Jaguars having completely disappeared from a number of areas.",

    "animal": "Kiwis",
    "description":
"Evolving in the absence of most large predators, the kiwi fills a similar ecological niche as many land mammals elsewhere, a fact reflected by the kiwi’s anatomy. Like many mammals, their bones are filled with marrow. They rely on their sense of touch and smell. And their soft feathers feel very much like fur. Nevertheless, despite considerable conservation efforts, this animal is in danger of becoming extinct.",
